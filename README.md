- Concurrent processing of requests
- Streaming response handling
- Built-in error handling and type safety
- Configurable settings
- Source verification for responses
- Simple and intuitive interface

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sujalrajpoot/blackbox-chat-client.git
cd blackbox-chat-client
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install cloudscraper
```

## üìñ Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from blackbox_chat import BlackBoxChat

# Create a chat instance
chat = BlackBoxChat()

# Send a query
try:
    response = chat.chat("What is artificial intelligence?")
    print(f"Response: {response['streaming_response']}")
    print(f"Sources: {response.get('sources', 'No sources found')}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {str(e)}")
```

### Advanced Configuration

```python
from blackbox_chat import BlackBoxChat, ChatConfig

# Configure custom settings
config = ChatConfig(
    max_tokens=2048,
    deep_search_mode=True,
    web_search_mode_prompt=True,
    timeout=60,
    prints=True
)

# Create chat instance with custom config
chat = BlackBoxChat(config)

# Use a specific model
response = chat.chat(
    "Explain quantum computing",
    model="GPT_4O"
)
```

## üîß Configuration Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| max_tokens | Maximum tokens in response | 1024 |
| deep_search_mode | Enable deep search | True |
| web_search_mode_prompt | Enable web search | True |
| timeout | Request timeout in seconds | 30 |
| prints | Print streaming responses | True |

## üìö Available Models

- `GPT_4O`: GPT-4 Optimized
- `GEMINI_PRO`: Google's Gemini Pro
- `CLAUDE_SONNET_35`: Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- `BLACKBOX_AI_PRO`: BlackBox AI Pro
- `BLACKBOX_AI`: Standard BlackBox AI

## üîç Error Handling

The client includes custom error types for better error handling:

```python
try:
    response = chat.chat("your query")
except ModelNotFoundError as e:
    print("Invalid model specified:", e)
except APIRequestError as e:
    print("API request failed:", e)
except BlackBoxError as e:
    print("General error:", e)
```

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- cloudscraper
- concurrent.futures (standard library)
- typing (standard library)
- dataclasses (standard library)
- enum (standard library)

## üîÆ Future Improvements

- Add async/await support
- Implement rate limiting
- Add unit tests
- Add logging system
- Create command-line interface
- Add support for conversation history
- Implement retry mechanism
- Add proxy support

## üö´ Known Limitations
